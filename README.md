# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We have so far used the Kickstarter data set to help an up-and-coming playwright Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, *Fever*. Througout this module we have used the same data set to analyze sort crowdfunding data to determine what makes a project's campaign successfull. 

### Purpose
We are going to dive a little deeper into this analysis of kickstarter data set in this assignment. As Louise's play *Fever* came close to it's fundraising goal ina  short amount of time, we are going to provide her information on different campaigns how they fared in relation to their launch dates and Goals.
We are are also providing charts to make it easier to determine performance of various campaigns based on category, goals, launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges
For fulfilling this purpose we could not use the Kickstarter data set as is and had to make changes to be able to summarize data. This way it became easier to analyze data and determine what was needed to achieve our goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Campaigns launched in May and June were most successful. Campaigns launched in Dec met with least success.
Campaigns launched in June, not only met with success but also many of them failed.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Difficulties encountered were usage of Excel. Having to know exactly how to make it work in Excel.
So practising more in this area by using the module leassons and also taking time out to analyze and get familiar with excel features made it helpful to overcome this difficulty.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Campaigns launched in May were most successful.
2. Campaigns launched in Jan, Hylu and October had the highest failures.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful campaigns had goal ranges of 5000-9999 and 15000-19999, with goal range of 1000-4999 being almost as successful as the other 2 goal ranges. Also Goals having less than 1000 were the least successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
From the data set it is not very clear to understand why goal ranges of 5000-9999 and 15000-19999 are most successful. Also there is no way to analyze why campaigns were canceled. Also no way to anaylze why goal range of less than 1000 (easiest to raise), has the most number of failed campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. We could create outcomes based on different parent categories and also subcategories.
2. We could also create tables/charts for which campaigns with which goal ranges had the shortest / longest campaigns.
